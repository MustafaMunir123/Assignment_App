# Quiz App

This is simple app where we can attemt questions added by the admin.
The home page "Dashboard" consists of questions added by the admin and there is a "Questions" page in the Navbar which can only accesssed by admin (using the superuser credentials). 

The Questions page contains the following:

1. Add Questions
        
        ● Here You can Add a list of questions which will be listed down in the  other section of "Questions" Page i.e. "Show All Questions".


2. Show All Questions

        ● This page displays all the added questions is a list, this page contains following features:
                
                ○ Update / Add Answers : You can add answers and can mark answers as correct for every question specifically also you can update questions from here.

                ○ Update : Here you can update question that you have already added.

                ○ Remove : From here you can delete a question from the list.


[NOTE] Questions page can only be accessed through admin credentials. Once you hit Logout in Navbar you can no longer access the "Questions" page unless logged In again.



P.S.The frontend of this app is really poor.
